## System description

The system is a .NET 10 web API for modelling and (over)analysing the Eurovision Song Contest, 2016-2025.

The system is composed of two APIs with a shared domain and database: the Public API and the Admin API.

### The Public API

The Public API is a set of GET endpoints for analysing the queryable voting data in the system.

Its feature groups are:

- Retrieving a digest of:
  - the participants in a single contest.
  - the competitors in a single broadcast.
  - the points given and/or received by a single country in a single broadcast.
  - the results achieved by a single country across contests.
- Retrieving an ordered list of:
  - all queryable broadcasts.
  - all queryable contests.
  - all queryable countries.
- Retrieving a page of rankings of:
  - competitors in broadcasts, using metrics calculated from the points they received in their broadcast.
  - competing countries, using metrics calculated from the points they have received across broadcasts.
  - voting countries, using metrics calculated from the points they have given across broadcasts.

### The Admin API

The Admin API is a set of GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE endpoints for populating the system with the queryable voting data in a manner that imitates the way the real-world voting is organized.

Its feature groups are:

- Creating, retrieving, updating and deleting countries in the system.
- Creating, retrieving, updating and deleting contests in the system.
- Creating, retrieving, updating and deleting broadcasts in the system.

## User roles

Two user roles - the EuroFan and the Admin - are defined for the purposes of defining user stories and writing acceptance test specifications.

### The EuroFan

The EuroFan is an authenticated user of the Public API. They are:

- A fan of the Eurovision Song Contest.
- Located anywhere in the world.
- Familiar with the structure and recent history of the Eurovision Song Contest.
- Knowledgeable about how the voting system works.
- Able to send HTTP requests and read responses.
- Interested in discovering insights from the voting data.

### The Admin

The Admin is the single authorized user of the Admin API. They are:

- A single software developer (Matt Tantony).
- The designer of the system, including its domain model and database schema.
- Located in the UK.
- Very familiar with the structure and recent history of the Eurovision Song Contest.
- Knowledgeable about how the voting system works.
- Able to send HTTP requests and read responses.
- Authorized to configure the web application and the database.

### Operational context

The system operates in the following context:

- A client communicates with the system using HTTP requests and responses.
- The language of the system is UK English.
- The web application is hosted in the cloud using the Azure Web App service.
- The system database is hosted in the cloud using an Azure SQL Database service.
- The web application and the database use free or very low-cost service tiers.
- Due to the service tier limitations, **the system database may not always be immediately available**. If this happens, the client must be directed to retry their request after 120 seconds.
